# This is the Rescomi general purpose repository

This repository contains example code snippet, general information, and any other information that you might want to read about or write about. Basic idea is to stop repeat inventions of the same work and let people learn how their colleagues code.

#

## Usage

#

Did you do a really cool trick with PHP for a customer that's has a close relationship with us?
Do you think someone else might need to do it later, or something similar, when working with the same customer?

Create a new directory accordingly and do a pull. Upload stuff that might be educational, entertaining, weird, or what ever.

The idea is to spread knowledge within what different NDA's allow.

If you have anything out side of code, that you think other people might find useful, submit it under "general knowledge"
